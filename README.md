 Driver Drowsiness Detection System

Introduction
The project is fully based on AI and lies in the field of computer vision and Machine learning. As the project focuses to capture the real-time drowsy state of driver through the eye state the dataset for building the model will be the images of eyes which is categorized into open eyes dataset and close eyes dataset. The model is built by training the open/close eyes images so the project is based on supervised learning and to build the model CNN (Convolution Neural Network) algorithm is used as it works better than other algorithm as the dataset are the set of images.
